This project was inspired by the idea of creating a digital defensible space in order to monitor environmental factors and detect early fire events. This build exposes the LoRa radio directly, and allows you to send data to any radios in range with the same radio parameters. All data is broadcasted and there is no addressing, which allows anyone to listen in.
